"Generate a pixel art logo featuring a sloth studying. The sloth should be depicted as a cute and friendly character, wearing glasses, and focused on reading a book. The overall aesthetic should be retro and reminiscent of 8-bit video game sprites. The color palette should be limited to a few key colors, perhaps greens, browns, and beiges, with a pop of color for the book. The background should be simple and unobtrusive, maybe a single solid color or a very basic pixelated pattern. The image should convey a sense of learning and relaxation."
